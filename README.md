# Hi, I'm Bobbs 👋

## About Me
I'm a 22-year-old tech enthusiast based in Plano, Texas with a deep passion for technology that goes back to building custom PCs at age 12. Over the past 6 years, I've been gaining real-world technical experience at Gero Flooring LLC, where I wore many hats — handling network hardware troubleshooting, asset management, inventory tracking, and project coordination, all while serving as the go-to person for general IT and tech support across the entire company.
I'm now channeling that hands-on foundation into a full-time career in cloud infrastructure and IT operations. I hold CompTIA Security+ and Network+ certifications, along with a Google Cybersecurity and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Foundations certification, and I'm driven by a genuine excitement for solving complex technical problems and building reliable systems. I thrive in fast-paced environments and love finding ways to make infrastructure smarter, more secure, and more efficient.
